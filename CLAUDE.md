## Communication Style

When communicating with the Freenet team, use tentative and modest language. Avoid assertive claims like 'I/Claude fixed' or 'discovered'. Instead use phrases like 'appears to be', 'may have', 'seems to', 'potentially'. Attribute work honestly (e.g., 'Claude identified what appears to be...'). Keep tone reserved and professional.
